# copycat-exercise

## About
This is a small exercise I found on a website that I decided i'd have a go at. The website of choice was the [original site](http://www.pairuptocode.com/exercises/copycat.html) because I wanted to make it a little bit odd.

## Use Cases
None really. Just a bit of fun.

## Licensing
The project is licensed under the [Unlicense License](http://unlicense.org "Unilicense Website") which means you can do whatever you like with this website.
